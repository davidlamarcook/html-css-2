        <p>Look
    If you had
    One shot
    Or one opportunity
    To seize everything you ever wanted
    In one moment
    Would you capture it
    Or just let it slip?
    Yo
    His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
    There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
    He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
    To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgettin'
    What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
    He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
    He's chokin', how, everybody's jokin' now
    The clocks run out, times up, over, blaow
    Snap back to reality, ope there goes gravity
    Ope, there goes Rabbit, he choked
    He's so mad, but he won't give up that easy? No
    He won't have it, he knows his whole back's to these ropes
    It don't matter, he's dope, he knows that, but he's broke
    He's so stagnant, he knows, when he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's
    Back to the lab again, yo, this whole rhapsody
    Better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him<br><br><br>
    You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
    You own it, you better never let it go
    You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
    This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
    You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
    You own it, you better never let it go
    You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
    This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
    You better, His soul's escaping, through this hole that is gaping
    This world is mine for the taking
    Make me king, as we move toward a New World Order
    A normal life is borin', but super stardom's close to post mortem
    It only grows harder, only grows hotter
    He blows, it's all over, these &$%# is all on him
    Coast to coast shows, he's known as the Globetrotter.</p>
